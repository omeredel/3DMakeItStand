# 3DMakeItStand
_Still in development_

## Introduction:
This algorithm lets users produce fabricated models, that after being 3D-printed, stand in one or more poses without requiring glue or heavy pedestals.

## The Algorithm:
We use balance optimization as an energy minimization, improving stability by modifying the volume of the object, while preserving its surface details.
